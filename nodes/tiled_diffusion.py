"""Experimental per-step spatial Tiled Diffusion for MiniMax H3.

Ported from shiimizu/ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion (MultiDiffusion / Mixture of
Diffusers). Instead of sampling each tile to completion and stitching the
latents afterwards (the 'spatial split' path of MMH3 Ultimate Upscale), this
node patches the model with a model_function_wrapper: every denoising step
slices the packed AV latent into spatial tiles, runs the DiT once per tile,
and blends the tile predictions into a shared full-frame buffer with uniform
or gaussian weights. All tiles advance through the same sigmas on the same
noise field, so no freeze/fade overlap masks (and no intermediate denoise-mask
values) are involved.

v1.1: tile windows carry GLOBAL frame positions. v1 gave mutually unrelated
tile contents because every tile's PackedLayout restarted its RoPE grid at
the tile origin, so the DiT treated each tile as a complete standalone frame.
_WindowLayout now derives each tile's layout from the full-frame layout,
keeping the window's true (h, w) coordinates and the full-frame audio
anchors, so a tile's prediction matches what the full-frame model would
predict inside that window - overlap blending then averages consistent
predictions instead of unrelated ones.

Usage: model -> MMH3 Tiled Diffusion -> MMH3 Ultimate Upscale, with the
Ultimate Upscale node's spatial_split_param LEFT UNCONNECTED so each temporal
chunk is sampled whole through the patched model. Temporal split and latent
upscale keep working unchanged.

Guidance:
- keep tile_overlap at a meaningful fraction of the tile size (>= ~25%), or
  the tiles decouple again; e.g. 128px on 1024px tiles is too weak
- lower denoise keeps the source latent anchoring the content

v1 limitations (experimental):
- no controlnet / fun control, no denoise mask, no inpaint chain
- tiles run sequentially inside each step (H3 requires batch size 1), so the
  node trades nothing for speed - its goal is seam quality and tile sync
- temporal tiling is not implemented; long videos still go through the
  Ultimate Upscale node's temporal split
